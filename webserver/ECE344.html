<h2>Lab 3: A Preemptive, User-Level Thread Package</h2>

<h4>Due Date: March 3, 11:59pm</h4>

<p>In the previous lab, you implemented a cooperative, user-level thread package
system in which <tt>thread_yield</tt> causes control to be passed from one
thread to the next one. This lab has four goals.</p>

<p>First, you will implement preemptive threading, in which simulated "timer
interrupts" cause the system to switch from one thread to another.</p>

<p>Second, you will implement the <tt>thread_sleep</tt> and <tt>thread_wakeup</tt> scheduling functions. These functions will enable implementing <b>blocking</b> mutual exclusion and synchronization.</p>

<p>Third, you will use the <tt>thread_sleep</tt> and <tt>thread_wakeup</tt> functions to implement <tt>thread_wait</tt>, which will block a thread until a target thread has finished executing.</p>

<p>Finally, you will implement blocking locks for mutual exclusion, and
condition variables for synchronization.</p>

<p>For this lab, we are not providing any additional code. You will be working
with the code you have implemented in the <tt>threads</tt> directory in Lab
2.</p>

<h2>Timer Signals</h2>

<p>User-level code cannot use hardware timer interrupts directly. Instead,
POSIX operating systems provide a software mechanism called <i>signals</i>
 that
can be used to simulate "interrupts" at the user level. These signals 
interrupt your program and give you a chance to handle that interrupt. 
For example, when you hit <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> to kill a program, that causes
 the OS to send the SIGINT signal to your program. Most programs don't 
handle this signal, so by default, the OS kills the process. However, if
 you wanted to save the state of your program before it was killed 
(e.g., a text editor could save any unsaved files), you can register a 
handler with the OS for SIGINT. Then when the user hits <tt>Ctrl-C</tt>, the OS calls your handler, you could write out the state of your program, and then exit.</p>

<p>More generally, signals are a form of asynchronous, inter-process 
communication mechanism. A signal can be sent from one process to 
another, or from a process to itself. We will use the <strong>latter</strong>
 method to have the process that invokes your user-level scheduler, 
i.e., your thread library functions, deliver timer signals to itself.</p>
  
<p>The operating system delivers a signal to a target (recipient) process by
  interrupting the normal flow of execution of the process. Execution can be
  interrupted after any instruction. A process can register a signal handler,
  which is invoked when the signal is delivered. After the signal handler
  finishes executing, the normal flow of execution of the process is
  resumed. Notice the similarities between signals and hardware interrupts.</p>

<p>As signals can be delivered after any instruction, signal handling is
 prone to race conditions. For example, if you increment a counter (<tt>counter = counter + 1</tt>)
 during normal execution as well as in your signal handler code, the 
increment operation may not work correctly because it is not atomic, and
 the signal may be delivered in between the instructions implementing 
the increment operation. To avoid this problem, you should disable 
signal delivery while the counter is being updated.</p>

<p>Please read a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal">short
introduction to signals</a> to understand how they work in more detail. Make
sure to read the "Risks" section or else you may not able to answer some
questions below.</p>

<p>Now go over the code in the files <tt>interrupt.h</tt>
and <tt>interrupt.c</tt>. You do not need to understand all the code, but it
will be helpful to know how the code should be used. We will use the terms
"interrupts" and "signals" interchangeably below.</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>void register_interrupt_handler(int verbose):</b></dt>
  
<dd>This call installs a timer signal handler in the calling program using
the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/sigaction"><tt>sigaction</tt></a> system
call. When a timer signal fires, the function <tt>interrupt_handler</tt> in
the <tt>interrupt.c</tt> file is invoked. With the <tt>verbose</tt> flag, a
message is printed when the handler function runs.</dd>

<dt><b>int interrupts_set(int enabled):</b></dt>

<dd>This function enables timer signals when enabled is 1, and disables (or
blocks) them when enabled is 0. We call the current enabled or disabled state of
the signal the <i>signal state</i>. This function also returns whether the
signals were previously enabled or not (i.e., the previous signal state). Notice
that the operating system ensures that these two operations (reading previous
state, and updating it) are performed atomically when
the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/sigprocmask"><tt>sigprocmask</tt></a>
system call is issued. Your code should use this function to disable signals
when running any code that is
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_section"><i>critical
section</i></a> (i.e., code that accesses data that is shared by multiple
threads).<br><br>

Why does this function return the previous signal state? The reason is that it
allows "stacking" calls to this function. The typical usage of this function is
as follows:

<pre>fn() {
    /* disable signals, store the previous signal state in "enabled" */  
    int enabled = interrupts_set(0);
    /* critical section */
    interrupts_set(enabled);
}
</pre>

The first call to <tt>interrupts_set</tt> disables signals. The second call
restores the signal state to its previous state, i.e., the signal state before
the first call to <tt>interrupts_set</tt>, rather than unconditionally enabling
signals. This is useful because the caller of the function <tt>fn</tt> may be
expecting signals to remain disabled after the function <tt>fn</tt> finishes
executing. For example:

<pre>fn_caller() {
    int enabled = interrupts_set(0);
    /* begin critical section */
    fn();
    /* code expects signals are still disabled */
    ...
    /* end critical section */
    interrupts_set(enabled);
}
</pre>

Notice how signal disabling and enabling is performed in "stack" order, so that
the signal state remains disabled after <tt>fn</tt> returns.<br><br>

The functions <tt>interrupts_on</tt> and <tt>interrupts_off</tt> are simple
wrappers for the <tt>interrupt_set</tt> function.
</dd>

<dt><b>int interrupts_enabled():</b></dt>

<dd>This function returns whether signals are enabled or disabled currently. You
can use this function to check (i.e., assert) whether your assumptions about the
signal state are correct.</dd>

<dt><b>void interrupts_quiet():</b></dt>

<dd>This function turns off printing signal handler messages.</dd>

</dl>

<p>To help you understand how this code works, we have provided you
the <tt>show_handler</tt> program. Look at the <tt>show_handler.c</tt> file and
make sure you understand the output of the <tt>show_handler</tt> program.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>You will be doing this lab within the <tt>threads</tt> directory that you
created in Lab 2. So make sure to go over the <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/davidlion/ece344/lab2.html#setup">setup
instructions</a> for Lab 2, if you have not done so previously.</p>

<p>Make sure to commit all your previous changes (or discard any uncommitted
changes) in your local repository, and then run the following commands to get
started with this lab.</p>

<pre>cd ~/ece344
git tag Lab3-start
cd threads
make
</pre>

<h2>Preemptive Threading</h2>

<p>Now you are ready to implement preemptive threading using the timer signals
described above. However, before you do so, make sure that you can answer the
following questions before proceeding any further.</p>

<ol>

<li>What is the name of the signal that you will be using to implement
  preemptive threading?</li>

<li>Which system call is used by the process to deliver signals to itself?</li>

<li>How often is this signal delivered?</li>

<li>When this signal is delivered, which function in <tt>thread.c</tt> is
invoked? What would this function do when it is invoked in
the <tt>show_handler</tt> program?</li>

<li>Is the signal state enabled or disabled when the function
in <tt>thread.c</tt> above is invoked?  If the signal is enabled, could it cause
problems? If the signal is disabled, what code will enable them? Hint: look
for <tt>sa_mask</tt> in <tt>interrupt.c</tt>.</li>

<li>What does <tt>unintr_printf</tt> do? Why is it needed? Will you need other
  similar functions?  Reread
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal">short introduction to
  signals</a> to find out.
</li>

</ol>

<p>Signals can be sent to the process at any time, even when a thread is in the
middle of a <tt>thread_yield</tt>, <tt>thread_create</tt>,
or <tt>thread_exit</tt> call. It is a very bad idea to allow multiple threads to
access shared variables (such as your ready queue) at the same time. You should
therefore
ensure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion"><i>mutual
exclusion</i></a>, i.e., only one thread can be in a critical section (accessing
the shared variables) in your thread library at a time.</p>

<p>A simple way to ensure mutual exclusion is to disable signals when you enter
procedures of the thread library and restore the signal state when you
leave.</p>

<p>Hint: think carefully about the invariants you want to maintain in your
thread functions about when signals are enabled and when they are disabled. Make
sure to use the <tt>interrupts_enabled</tt> function to check your
assumptions.</p>

<p>Note that as a result of thread context switches, the thread that disables
signals may not be the one enables them. In particular, recall
that <tt>setcontext</tt> <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/davidlion/ece344/lab2.html#context-switch">restores the
register state</a> saved by <tt>getcontext</tt>. The signal state is saved
when <tt>getcontext</tt> is called (recall the <tt>show_interrupt</tt> function
in the <tt>show_ucontext.c</tt> file is Lab 2), and restored
by <tt>setcontext</tt>.  As a result, if you would like your code to be running
with a specific signal state (i.e., disabled or enabled)
when <tt>setcontext</tt> is called, make sure that <tt>getcontext</tt> is called
with the same signal state. Maintain the right invariants, and you'll have no
trouble dealing with context switches.</p>

<p>It will be helpful to go over
the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/setcontext">manual pages</a> of the
context save and restore calls again.</p>

<p>Go ahead and implement preemptive threading by adding signal disabling and
enabling code in your thread library in <tt>thread.c</tt>.</p>

<p>After you implement preemptive threading, you can test your code by running the <tt>test_preemptive</tt> program. To check whether this program worked correctly, you can run the following tester script:</p>

<pre>    /cad2/ece344s/tester/scripts/lab3-01-preemptive.py
</pre>

<p>This script is run as part of testing Lab 3. Adding the <tt>-v</tt> option to the script above will provide more information about what output is expected by the tester.</p>

<h2>Sleep and Wakeup</h2>

<p>Now that you have implemented preemptive threading, you will extend your
threading library to implement the <tt>thread_sleep</tt>
and <tt>thread_wakeup</tt> functions. These functions will allow implementing
mutual exclusion and synchronization primitives. In real operating systems,
these functions would also be used to suspend and wake up a thread that performs
IO with slow devices, such as disks and networks. The <tt>thread_sleep</tt>
primitive blocks or suspends a thread when it is waiting on an event, such as a
mutex lock becoming available or the arrival of a network
packet. The <tt>thread_wakeup</tt> primitive awakens one or more threads that
are waiting for the corresponding event.</p>

<p>The <tt>thread_sleep</tt> and <tt>thread_wakeup</tt> functions that you will
be implementing for this lab are summarized here:</p>

<dl>
  
<dt><b>Tid thread_sleep(struct wait_queue *queue):</b></dt>
  
<dd>
This function suspends the caller and then runs some other thread. The calling
thread is put in a wait queue passed as a parameter to the
function. The <tt>wait_queue</tt> data structure is similar to the run queue,
but there can be many wait queues in the system, one per type of event or
condition. Upon success, this function returns the identifier of the thread that
took control as a result of the function call. The calling thread does not see
this result until it runs later. Upon failure, the calling thread continues
running, and returns one of these constants:

<ul>

<li><tt>THREAD_INVALID:</tt> alerts the caller that the queue is invalid,
e.g., it is NULL.</li>

<li><tt>THREAD_NONE:</tt> alerts the caller that there are no more 
threads, other than the caller, that are ready to run. Note that if the 
thread were to sleep in this case, then your program would hang because 
there would be no runnable thread. </li>

</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>int thread_wakeup(struct wait_queue *queue, int all):</b></dt>
  
<dd>
This function wakes up one or more threads that are suspended in the wait
queue. These threads are put in the ready queue. The calling thread continues to
execute and receives the result of the call. When "all" is 0, then one thread is
woken up. In this case, you should wake up threads in FIFO order, i.e., first
thread to sleep must be woken up first. When "all" is 1, all suspended threads
are woken up. The function returns the number of threads that were woken up. It
should return zero if the queue is invalid, or there were no suspended threads
in the wait queue.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>You will need to implement a <tt>wait_queue</tt> data structure before
implementing the functions above. The <tt>thread.h</tt> file provides the
interface for this data structure. As an optimization, note that each thread can
be in only one queue at a time (a run queue or any one wait queue).</p>

<p>When implementing <tt>thread_sleep</tt>, it will help to think about the
similarities and differences between this function and <tt>thread_yield</tt>
and <tt>thread_exit</tt>. Make sure that <tt>thread_sleep</tt> suspends (blocks)
the current thread rather than spinning (running) in a tight loop. This would
defeat the purpose of invoking <tt>thread_sleep</tt> because the thread would
still be using the CPU.</p>

<p>All the thought that you put into ensuring that thread preemption works
correctly previously will apply to these functions as well. In particular, these
functions access shared data structures (which ones?), so be sure to enforce
mutual exclusion.</p>

<p>Go ahead and implement these functions in your thread library
in <tt>thread.c</tt>.</p>

<p>After you implement the sleep and wakeup functions, you can test your code by
running the <tt>test_wakeup</tt> and the <tt>test_wakeup_all</tt> programs. To
check whether these programs worked correctly, you can run the following tester
commands:</p>

<pre>    /cad2/ece344s/tester/scripts/lab3-02-wakeup.py
    /cad2/ece344s/tester/scripts/lab3-03-wakeupall.py
</pre>

<h2>Waiting for Threads to Exit</h2>

<p>Now that you have implemented the <tt>thread_sleep</tt> and <tt>thread_wakeup</tt>
 functions for suspending and waking up threads, you can use them to 
implement blocking synchronization primitives in your threads library. 
You should start by implementing the <tt>thread_wait</tt> function, 
which will block or suspend a thread until a target thread terminates 
(or exits). Once the target thread exits, and is <strong>fully destroyed</strong>, the thread that invokes <tt>thread_wait</tt>
 should continue operation. As an example, this synchronization 
mechanism can be used to ensure that a program (using a master thread) 
exits only after all its worker threads have completed their operations.</p>

<p>The <tt>thread_wait</tt> function is summarized below:</p>

<dl>

  <dt><b>int thread_wait(Tid tid):</b></dt>
  
  <dd>This function suspends the calling thread until the thread whose 
identifier is tid terminates. A thread terminates when it invokes <tt>thread_exit</tt>
 and its state is destroyed. Upon success, this function returns the 
identifier of the thread that exited. Upon failure, the calling thread 
continues running, and returns one of these constants:

<ul>

  <li><tt>THREAD_INVALID:</tt> alerts the caller that the identifier tid
 does not correspond to a valid thread (e.g., any negative value of 
tid), or it is the current thread.</li>

</ul>
  </dd>

</dl>

<p>You will need to associate a <tt>wait queue</tt> with each thread. When a thread invokes <tt>thread_wait</tt>, it should sleep on the <tt>wait queue</tt> of the target thread. When the target thread invokes exit, and is about to be destroyed, it should wake up the threads in its <tt>wait queue</tt>.</p>

<p>While this functionality is relatively simple to implement, you will need to ensure that there are no races between <tt>thread_wait</tt> and <tt>thread_exit</tt>. How will you do that?</p>

<p>One issue with implementing <tt>thread_wait</tt> is that a deadlock 
may occur. For example, if Thread A waits on Thread B, and then Thread B
 waits on Thread A, then both threads will deadlock. We do not expect 
you to handle this condition for the lab, but it will be helpful to 
think about how would implement <tt>thread_wait</tt> to avoid any deadlocks.</p>

<p>Go ahead and implement <tt>thread_wait</tt> in your thread library 
and update any other relevant functions. After you implement this 
functionality, you can test your code by running the <tt>test_wait</tt> and <tt>test_wait_kill</tt> programs. To check whether these programs worked correctly, you can run the following tester command:</p>

<pre>    /cad2/ece344s/tester/scripts/lab3-04-wait.py
</pre>

<h2>Mutex Locks and Condition Variables</h2>

<p>Now you are ready to implement mutual exclusion and synchronization 
primitives in your threads library. Recall that these primitives form 
the basis for managing concurrency, which is a core concern for 
operating systems, so your library would not really be complete without 
them.</p>

<p>For mutual exclusion, you will implement blocking locks, and for
synchronization, you will implement condition variables.</p>

<p>The API for the lock functions are described below:</p>

<dl>
  
<dt><b>struct lock *lock_create():</b></dt>
<dd>Create a blocking lock. Initially, the lock should be available. Your code
should associate a wait queue with the lock so that threads that need to acquire
the lock can wait in this queue.</dd>

<dt><b>void lock_destroy(struct lock *lock):</b></dt>
<dd>Destroy the lock. Be sure to check that the lock is available when it is
being destroyed.</dd>

<dt><b>void lock_acquire(struct lock *lock):</b></dt>
<dd>Acquire the lock. Threads should be suspended until they can acquire the
lock, after which this function should return.</dd>

<dt><b>void lock_release(struct lock *lock):</b></dt>
<dd>Release the lock. Be sure to check that the lock had been acquired by the
calling thread, before it is released. Wake up all threads that are waiting to
acquire the lock.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The API for the condition variable functions are described below:</p>

<dl>

<dt><b>struct cv *cv_create():</b></dt>
<dd>Create a condition variable. Your code should associate a wait queue with
the condition variable so that threads can wait in this queue.</dd>

<dt><b>void cv_destroy(struct cv *cv):</b></dt>
<dd>Destroy the condition variable. Be sure to check that no threads are waiting
on the condition variable.</dd>

<dt><b>void cv_wait(struct cv *cv, struct lock *lock):</b></dt>
<dd>Suspend the calling thread on the condition variable <tt>cv</tt>. Be sure to
check that the calling thread had acquired <tt>lock</tt> when this call is
made. You will need to release the lock before waiting, and reacquire it before
returning from this function.</dd>

<dt><b>void cv_signal(struct cv *cv, struct lock *lock):</b></dt>
<dd>Wake up one thread that is waiting on the condition variable <tt>cv</tt>. Be
sure to check that the calling thread had acquired <tt>lock</tt> when this call
is made.</dd>

<dt><b>void cv_broadcast(struct cv *cv, struct lock *lock):</b></dt>
<dd>Wake up all threads that are waiting on the condition
variable <tt>cv</tt>. Be sure to check that the calling thread had
acquired <tt>lock</tt> when this call is made.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The <tt>lock_acquire</tt>, <tt>lock_release</tt> functions, and
the <tt>cv_wait</tt>, <tt>cv_signal</tt> and <tt>cv_broadcast</tt> functions
access shared data structures (which ones?), so be sure to enforce mutual
exclusion.</p>

<p>Go ahead and implement these functions in your thread library
in <tt>thread.c</tt>.</p>

<p>After you implement these functions, you can test your code by running
the <tt>test_lock</tt> and the <tt>test_cv</tt> programs. To check whether these
programs worked correctly, you can run the following tester commands:</p>

<pre>    /cad2/ece344s/tester/scripts/lab3-05-lock.py
    /cad2/ece344s/tester/scripts/lab3-06-cv-signal.py
    /cad2/ece344s/tester/scripts/lab3-07-cv-broadcast.py    
</pre>

<h2>Hints and Advice</h2> 

<p>You are encouraged to reuse <i>your own</i> code that you might have
developed in the first lab or in previous courses for common data structures and operations such as queues, sorting, etc.</p>

<p>You may <b>not</b> use code that subsumes the heart of this project (e.g.,
you should not base your solution on wrappers of or code taken from the POSIX
thread library). If in doubt, ask.</p>

<p>This project does not require you to write a large number of lines of
code. It does require you to think carefully about the code you write. Before
you dive into writing code, it will pay to spend time planning and understanding
the code you are going to write. If you think the problem through from beginning
to end, this project will not be too hard. If you try to hack your way out of
trouble, you will spend many frustrating nights in the lab. This project's main
difficulty is in conceptualizing the solution. Once you overcome that hurdle,
you will be surprised at the simplicity of the implementation!</p>
