# Operating Systems

## Lab Information
- Programming Language: C
- Lab1 - Warmup: 
  - Review C by writing some C programs
  - Simple programs list:
    - **Hello**: hello.c that prints out the string "Hello world\n".
    - **Loops**: prints out the words from the command line on different lines.
    - **Procedure Calls**: uses recursion to calculate and print the factorial of the positive integer value that passed in as an argument 
    - **Headers, Linking, Structs**
    - **Linked List**
    - **Hash Table**
- Lab 2&3 - Thread
  - Create a library of functions that define **user-level threads package**.
  - The program can create threads, destroy threads and run threads concurrently on a single processor.
  - The program is able to block mutual exclusion and synchronization.
- Lab 4&5 - Web Server
  - Develop a **multi-threaded web server** and evaluate its performance
  - Improve the multi-threaded web server, change it into a **caching web server** to increase efficiency.
